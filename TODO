🔴 critical tasks (bugs):

🟠 high priority tasks (new features):
  ☐ @high drivers module - update service
  ☐ @high drivers module - routes
  ☐ @high races module - find by date service
  ☐ @high races module - find by date controller

🟡 low priority tasks (future plans):
  ☐ @low add "all_time_drivers" field to team model
  ☐ @low change "drivers" field to "current_drivers" field on team model
  ☐ @low races modules - find all races services
  ☐ @low races modules - find all races controller (returning how many races have occured)
  ☐ @low races model - add a field for cancelled (boolean)
  ☐ @low create circuit model
  ☐ @low implement SOLID
